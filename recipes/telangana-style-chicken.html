Take the pan off the heat and cool completely.</li> <li>Grind to Powder: Grind the cooled roasted spices to a fine powder in a spice grinder and set aside.</li> <li>Make Coconut Paste: In the same pan, add the grated coconut and dry fry for 10 minutes, stirring well. Cool, then add to a grinder with 50 mls of water and grind to a smooth paste. Set aside.</li> <li>Make Ginger-Garlic Paste: Grind the roughly chopped ginger and garlic to a smooth paste and set aside.</li> </ol>   

Cook the Curry:

Fry for 2 minutes and stir well. Add half of the curry leaves along with the coconut paste. Fry on medium heat for 4-5 minutes, adding a couple of tablespoons of water if needed to prevent sticking.</li> <li>Add Chicken and Spices: Add the cleaned chicken, turmeric powder, paprika/chilli powder, and the blended spice powder.
