    <p>Muddha Pappu, also known as <strong>Kandi Pappu</strong>, is a traditional and comforting lentil dish from the Telugu cuisine of South India. Made with toor dal (pigeon peas), this simple yet flavorful recipe is a staple in many households. It is often enjoyed with steamed rice and a variety of side dishes, making it a wholesome and satisfying meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients and Instructions:</h3>
    <p>Ingredients Needed for Muddha Pappu:
        <ol >
            <li>1 cup Toor Dal (Kandi pappu or yellow lentils)</li>
            <li>3 cups Water</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Can add <em>Turmeric powder</em></li>
            <li>2 tbsp Ghee (clarified butter) </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step-by-Step Instructions</h5>
        <p>Prepare the Dal: 
            
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Wash the toor dal thoroughly multiple times under running water.</li>
            <li>Pressure Cook: Place the washed dal in a pressure cooker and add the water. For an optional extra aroma, you can dry roast the dal lightly before washing.</li>
            <li>Cook: Close the pressure cooker lid and cook for about 3-5 whistles on medium-high heat, then simmer on low for a few minutes. The goal is to have the dal completely cooked and mashable.</li>
            <li>Release Pressure: Allow the pressure to release naturally. Do not open the cooker lid until the pressure has fully subsided.</li>
            <li>Mash and Season: Open the cooker and add salt to the cooked dal. Use a ladle or a wooden masher to mash the dal well until it reaches a thick, creamy consistency. If it is too thick, you can add a little hot water to adjust the consistency.</li>
            <li>Add Ghee and Serve: Stir in the ghee (clarified butter) and mix well. Serve the hot Mudda Pappu immediately with steamed rice and your favorite mango pickle or a tangy Pulusu stew.</li></ol></p>
